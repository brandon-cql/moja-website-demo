It’s a season: a vague, end-of-summer haze when Twitter breaks new ground in spooky puns and bars drape cotton cobwebs over their cash registers. Maybe the actual day mattered once, when a pillowcase full of two-bite candy bars was all you needed for a good night out. But times change, The Monster Mash doesn’t last forever, and we keep swapping old costumes for new ones.</p><p>To celebrate, we’re featuring a few of our favorite stories about All Hallow’s Eve. The scary, the spooky, the… actually very insightful stories about reportedly haunted places. Plus, a few deep-dives into the history and culture of Halloween itself. How did an ancient harvest festival evolve into David S. Pumpkins, and why does it matter? These reads might do the trick:</p><figure><a href="https://medium.com/s/in-the-dark/halloween-for-real-7aadcf30d1e6"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*EVOTjjz8q8woOEjv_yJWuw.png" /></a></figure><p>Historian <a href="https://medium.com/u/64c49bd92b9e">Mitch Horowitz</a> breaks down the history (and future) of Halloween, from its pagan beginnings through today.</p><figure><a href="https://medium.com/@zabado11/halloween-a9ac331d1ebf"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0IN4TI6xtcl6IncBhOddYw.png" /></a></figure><p>In a series of bite-sized vignettes, <a href="https://medium.com/u/32c7904533de">Lisa Renee</a> expresses exactly why she loathes Halloween: candy is a corn syrup-infused racket, and trick-or-treating brings out the greed in just about everybody.</p><figure><a href="https://medium.com/@shortformernie/pop-up-halloween-store-history-3159c6d5f574"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ct0QtLHL5sAz1YpOGLqQtw.png" /></a></figure><p>Ever wondered about those Halloween pop-ups that seem to invade U.S. strip malls every October? <a href="https://medium.com/u/26ab7ea2877">Ernie Smith</a> delves into the economics.</p><figure><a href="https://medium.com/@mshannabrooks/fact-checking-my-ghost-stories-34796d25137d"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Ui-bZdwOBmtINucjasVcww.png" /></a></figure><p>In a less literal take on Halloween, <a href="https://medium.com/u/9d884bfe6887">Hanna Brooks Olsen</a> confronts her personal ghosts and wonders, <em>Can you ever be haunted by something that never was?</em></p><figure><a href="https://modernmythology.net/riding-the-blurry-borders-the-evidence-for-phantom-hitchhikers-6a76538f9805"><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*SbrXH4nVp8HPgDJCnP1NuA.png" /></a></figure><p>Writer and researcher <a href="https://medium.com/u/adfbc8c9837b">David Metcalfe</a> asks: would you even know a ghost if you saw one?
