(Probably because we spent most of it processing 2016.) With laws, leadership, and social norms changing at a pace so relentless our data plans can scarcely keep up, our mental energy is spent skimming endless push notifications, rather than taking the time to step back and think about what it all means.</p><p>From AI to cryptocurrency, #MeToo to #VegasStrong, and tax reform to net neutrality, millions of readers turned to Medium this year to read beyond the headlines, make sense of the senseless, and draw inspiration from fresh voices.

The result is <a href="https://medium.com/wordsthatmatter">a collection</a> of over 40 essays that explores the buzzwords, the bad days, the violence, and the victories that make up a year — one word at a time.</p><p>We’ve invited a diverse set of voices across a spectrum of topics. <a href="https://medium.com/u/db7a8ceac708">John McCain</a> exposes how chaos defeated order this year, and <a href="https://medium.com/u/762ff63cce75">Hillary Clinton</a> argues for the value of radical empathy. <a href="https://medium.com/u/d5f6a126e0de">Roxane Gay</a> dives into why words — and the truth — still matter, while <a href="https://medium.com/u/ced93b39d76">Margaret E.
