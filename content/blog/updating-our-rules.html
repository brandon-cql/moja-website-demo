title = "Updating Our Rules"

+++
<p>Today, we are updating our rules to help strengthen our community.</p><p>As the internet has evolved in the five years since we launched, so has the way people use Medium. To accommodate this, we regularly assess our rules, and adjust them accordingly.</p><p>We strive to be a place where everyone is welcome to share, read, and engage with the stories that matter to them. When we see abuse of this system, we act quickly and fairly to take appropriate action. Where our policies fail, we carefully analyze and update them.</p><p>Beyond Medium itself, we recognize that we are also part of the larger internet ecosystem. Just as we rely on outside technology, systems, and information to run Medium, we also consider off-platform signals when assessing potential rules violations.</p><p>We have all seen an increase and evolution of online hate, abuse, harassment, and disinformation, along with ever-evolving campaigns of fraud and spam. To continue to be good citizens of the internet, and provide our users with a trusted and safe environment to read, write, and share new ideas, we have strengthened our policies around this type of behavior.</p><p>One of the most critical signals we rely on in maintaining a high standard of quality is you, our community of readers, authors, and thinkers. We appreciate your many contributions to making Medium a better platform.</p><p>If you find content you believe violates our rules, please flag it for our Trust and Safety team to review, or <a href="https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=160277">email us</a> with more information.</p><p>You can read our updated rules <a href="https://medium.com/policy/medium-rules-30e5502c4eb4">here</a>.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Medium Trust and Safety</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=d99d594d1a0c" width="1" height="1"><hr><p><a href="https://blog.medium.com/updating-our-rules-d99d594d1a0c">Updating Our Rules</a> was originally published in <a href="https://blog.medium.com">3 min read</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>
